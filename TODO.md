# TODO

## CI/CD

- set up eslint
- set up prettier
- set up conventional commits
- (?) set up husky
- set up github actions etc.

## Components

- Display errors on fields
- ~~create NavBar~~
- transition on Box
- ~~Box - on clicking outside the Box is closed~~
- ~~make cart responsive~~
- Nav underline current category that the user is on
- make the ItemHeader menus hoverable instead of clickable
- make the Navbar sticky
- consider making the Navbar transparent (redesign)
- change the space screenWithoutHeader so it is pixel perfect both on mobile and desktop
- after rethinking and reimplementing the Navbar have a look at item page at the right section and its spacing
- item container - if the last item is alone in the row it's alignment is slightly off
- account menu - make the logout invisible when not logged in
- create Number Input and add it to Item Creation
- somehow animate the height of ItemCreationDialog
- multiselect count is broken after clicking "ESC" on opened menu

## Pages

- ~~get better image quality and optimize it - https://squoosh.app/~~

## Misc

- custom scroll (e.g. cart)

## Low Priority

- Color picker and adding new colors to DB.
- Color display in Select
- searchBar enhancement - maybe fuzzy search?
- give size chart functionality
- custom cursor (e.g. when hovering on out of stock items)
