# TODO

## CI/CD

- set up eslint
- set up prettier
- set up conventional commits
- (?) set up husky
- set up github actions etc.

##Components

- ~~create NavBar~~
- transition on Box
- ~~Box - on clicking outside the Box is closed~~

- searchBar enhancement - maybe fuzzy search?
- ~~make cart responsive~~
- Nav underline current category that the user is on
- make the ItemHeader menus hoverable instead of clickable
- make the Navbar sticky
- consider making the Navbar transparent (redesign)
- change the space screenWithoutHeader so it is pixel perfect both on mobile and desktop
- after rethinking and reimplementing the Navbar have a look at item page at the right section and its spacing

## Pages

- ~~get better image quality and optimize it - https://squoosh.app/~~

## Misc

- custom scroll (e.g. cart)
- custom cursor (e.g. when hovering on out of stock items)
- give size chart functionality
