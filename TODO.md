# TODO

## Components

- Display errors on fields
- SearchBar logic - maybe fuzzy search?
- Transition on Box

- Nav underline current category that the user is on
- Make the ItemHeader menus hoverable instead of clickable

- Item availibility form - change default value state behaviour
- Make item creation go back to default values set from refs
- Item reservation in cart
- Item container - if the last item is alone in the row it's alignment is slightly off

## Low Priority

- Toasts on adding/deleting/editing users/items etc.
- Color picker and adding new colors to DB.
- Color display in Select
- Additional modal, dropdown to confirm deletion of item/user

- display more data in user preview in admin panel
- isLoading state in UserDetailsDialog in admin view
- user list dialog, throws one trpc error after deleting a user (there is one request to fetch user details but the user is no longer existing)

- custom scroll (e.g. cart)
- custom cursor (e.g. when hovering on out of stock items)
- Give size chart functionality
- enhance Loader - /item-creator
- enhance handeling the states between forms in item-creator, right now it looks hacky and ugly
